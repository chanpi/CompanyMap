 @brief Adds JSON generation to Foundation classes
 
 This is a category on NSObject that adds methods for returning JSON representations
 of standard objects to the objects themselves. This means you can call the
 -JSONRepresentation method on an NSArray object and it'll do what you want.

 @li NSArray
 @li NSString
 @li NSNumber (also used for booleans)
